       "[Document(metadata={'source': '../../test_data/input/BERT Paper.pdf', 'page': 0}, page_content='BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for\\nLanguage Understanding\\nJacob Devlin Ming-Wei Chang Kenton Lee Kristina Toutanova\\nGoogle AI Language\\n{jacobdevlin,mingweichang,kentonl,kristout}@google.com\\nAbstract\\nWe introduce a new language representa-\\ntion model called BERT, which stands for\\nBidirectional Encoder Representations from\\nTransformers. Unlike recent language repre-\\nsentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad-\\nford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-\\ntrain deep bidirectional representations from\\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\\nleft and right context in all layers. As a re-\\nsult, the pre-trained BERT model can be ﬁne-\\ntuned with just one additional output layer\\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\\nlanguage inference, without substantial task-\\nspeciﬁc architecture modiﬁcations.\\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\\npowerful.

These include sentence-level tasks such as\\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-\\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\\nwhere models are required to produce ﬁne-grained\\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).\\nThere are two existing strategies for apply-\\ning pre-trained language representations to down-\\nstream tasks: feature-based and ﬁne-tuning. The\\nfeature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters\\net al., 2018a), uses task-speciﬁc architectures that\\ninclude the pre-trained representations as addi-\\ntional features. The ﬁne-tuning approach, such as\\nthe Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI\\nGPT) (Radford et al., 2018), introduces minimal\\ntask-speciﬁc parameters, and is trained on the\\ndownstream tasks by simply ﬁne-tuning all pre-\\ntrained parameters. The two approaches share the\\nsame objective function during pre-training, where\\nthey use unidirectional language models to learn\\ngeneral language representations.\\nWe argue that current techniques restrict the\\npower of the pre-trained representations, espe-\\ncially for the ﬁne-tuning approaches. The ma-\\njor limitation is that standard language models are\\nunidirectional, and this limits the choice of archi-\\ntectures that can be used during pre-training. For\\nexample, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-to-\\nright architecture, where every token can only at-\\ntend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers\\nof the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such re-\\nstrictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks,\\nand could be very harmful when applying ﬁne-\\ntuning based approaches to token-level tasks such\\nas question answering, where it is crucial to incor-\\nporate context from both directions.\\nIn this paper, we improve the ﬁne-tuning based\\napproaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional\\nEncoder Representations from Transformers.\\nBERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidi-\\nrectionality constraint by using a “masked lan-\\nguage model” (MLM) pre-training objective, in-\\nspired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953). The\\nmasked language model randomly masks some of\\nthe tokens from the input, and the objective is to\\npredict the original vocabulary id of the masked\\narXiv:1810.04805v2  [cs.CL]  24 May 2019'),\n",

Unlike left-to-\\nright language model pre-training, the MLM ob-\\njective enables the representation to fuse the left\\nand the right context, which allows us to pre-\\ntrain a deep bidirectional Transformer. In addi-\\ntion to the masked language model, we also use\\na “next sentence prediction” task that jointly pre-\\ntrains text-pair representations. The contributions\\nof our paper are as follows:\\n• We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional\\npre-training for language representations. Un-\\nlike Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirec-\\ntional language models for pre-training, BERT\\nuses masked language models to enable pre-\\ntrained deep bidirectional representations. This\\nis also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which\\nuses a shallow concatenation of independently\\ntrained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs.\\n• We show that pre-trained representations reduce\\nthe need for many heavily-engineered task-\\nspeciﬁc architectures. BERT is the ﬁrst ﬁne-\\ntuning based representation model that achieves\\nstate-of-the-art performance on a large suite\\nof sentence-level and token-level tasks, outper-\\nforming many task-speciﬁc architectures.\\n• BERT advances the state of the art for eleven\\nNLP tasks. The code and pre-trained mod-\\nels are available at https://github.com/\\ngoogle-research/bert.\\n2 Related Work\\nThere is a long history of pre-training general lan-\\nguage representations, and we brieﬂy review the\\nmost widely-used approaches in this section.\\n2.1 Unsupervised Feature-based Approaches\\nLearning widely applicable representations of\\nwords has been an active area of research for\\ndecades, including non-neural (Brown et al., 1992;\\nAndo and Zhang, 2005; Blitzer et al., 2006) and\\nneural (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al.,\\n2014) methods. Pre-trained word embeddings\\nare an integral part of modern NLP systems, of-\\nfering signiﬁcant improvements over embeddings\\nlearned from scratch (Turian et al., 2010). To pre-\\ntrain word embedding vectors, left-to-right lan-\\nguage modeling objectives have been used (Mnih\\nand Hinton, 2009), as well as objectives to dis-\\ncriminate correct from incorrect words in left and\\nright context (Mikolov et al., 2013).\\nThese approaches have been generalized to\\ncoarser granularities, such as sentence embed-\\ndings (Kiros et al., 2015; Logeswaran and Lee,\\n2018) or paragraph embeddings (Le and Mikolov,\\n2014). To train sentence representations, prior\\nwork has used objectives to rank candidate next\\nsentences (Jernite et al., 2017; Logeswaran and\\nLee, 2018), left-to-right generation of next sen-\\ntence words given a representation of the previous\\nsentence (Kiros et al., 2015), or denoising auto-\\nencoder derived objectives (Hill et al., 2016).\\nELMo and its predecessor (Peters et al., 2017,\\n2018a) generalize traditional word embedding re-\\nsearch along a different dimension. They extract\\ncontext-sensitive features from a left-to-right and a\\nright-to-left language model. The contextual rep-\\nresentation of each token is the concatenation of\\nthe left-to-right and right-to-left representations.\\nWhen integrating contextual word embeddings\\nwith existing task-speciﬁc architectures, ELMo\\nadvances the state of the art for several major NLP\\nbenchmarks (Peters et al., 2018a) including ques-\\ntion answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), sentiment\\nanalysis (Socher et al., 2013), and named entity\\nrecognition (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder,\\n2003). Melamud et al. (2016) proposed learning\\ncontextual representations through a task to pre-\\ndict a single word from both left and right context\\nusing LSTMs. Similar to ELMo, their model is\\nfeature-based and not deeply bidirectional. Fedus\\net al. (2018) shows that the cloze task can be used\\nto improve the robustness of text generation mod-\\nels.\\n2.2 Unsupervised Fine-tuning Approaches\\nAs with the feature-based approaches, the ﬁrst\\nworks in this direction only pre-trained word em-\\nbedding parameters from unlabeled text (Col-\\nlobert and Weston, 2008).\\nMore recently, sentence or document encoders\\nwhich produce contextual token representations\\nhave been pre-trained from unlabeled text and\\nﬁne-tuned for a supervised downstream task (Dai\\nand Le, 2015; Howard and Ruder, 2018; Radford\\net al., 2018). The advantage of these approaches\\nis that few parameters need to be learned from\\nscratch. At least partly due to this advantage,\\nOpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018) achieved pre-\\nviously state-of-the-art results on many sentence-\\nlevel tasks from the GLUE benchmark (Wang\\net al., 2018a).

Computer vision research has also demon-\\nstrated the importance of transfer learning from\\nlarge pre-trained models, where an effective recipe\\nis to ﬁne-tune models pre-trained with Ima-\\ngeNet (Deng et al., 2009; Yosinski et al., 2014).\\n3 BERT\\nWe introduce BERT and its detailed implementa-\\ntion in this section. There are two steps in our\\nframework: pre-training and ﬁne-tuning. Dur-\\ning pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled\\ndata over different pre-training tasks. For ﬁne-\\ntuning, the BERT model is ﬁrst initialized with\\nthe pre-trained parameters, and all of the param-\\neters are ﬁne-tuned using labeled data from the\\ndownstream tasks. Each downstream task has sep-\\narate ﬁne-tuned models, even though they are ini-\\ntialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The\\nquestion-answering example in Figure 1 will serve\\nas a running example for this section.\\nA distinctive feature of BERT is its uniﬁed ar-\\nchitecture across different tasks. There is mini-\\nmal difference between the pre-trained architec-\\nture and the ﬁnal downstream architecture.\\nModel Architecture BERT’s model architec-\\nture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer en-\\ncoder based on the original implementation de-\\nscribed in Vaswani et al. (2017) and released in\\nthe tensor2tensor library.1 Because the use\\nof Transformers has become common and our im-\\nplementation is almost identical to the original,\\nwe will omit an exhaustive background descrip-\\ntion of the model architecture and refer readers to\\nVaswani et al. (2017) as well as excellent guides\\nsuch as “The Annotated Transformer.”2\\nIn this work, we denote the number of layers\\n(i.e., Transformer blocks) as L, the hidden size as\\nH, and the number of self-attention heads as A.3\\nWe primarily report results on two model sizes:\\nBERTBASE (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Param-\\neters=110M) and BERTLARGE (L=24, H=1024,\\nA=16, Total Parameters=340M).\\nBERTBASE was chosen to have the same model\\nsize as OpenAI GPT for comparison purposes.\\nCritically, however, the BERT Transformer uses\\nbidirectional self-attention, while the GPT Trans-\\nformer uses constrained self-attention where every\\ntoken can only attend to context to its left.4\\n1https://github.com/tensorﬂow/tensor2tensor\\n2http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html\\n3In all cases we set the feed-forward/ﬁlter size to be 4H,\\ni.e., 3072 for the H = 768and 4096 for the H = 1024.\\n4We note that in the literature the bidirectional Trans-'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '../../test_data/input/BERT Paper.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='Input/Output Representations To make BERT\\nhandle a variety of down-stream tasks, our input\\nrepresentation is able to unambiguously represent\\nboth a single sentence and a pair of sentences\\n(e.g., ⟨Question, Answer ⟩) in one token sequence.\\nThroughout this work, a “sentence” can be an arbi-\\ntrary span of contiguous text, rather than an actual\\nlinguistic sentence. A “sequence” refers to the in-\\nput token sequence to BERT, which may be a sin-\\ngle sentence or two sentences packed together.\\nWe use WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al.,\\n2016) with a 30,000 token vocabulary. The ﬁrst\\ntoken of every sequence is always a special clas-\\nsiﬁcation token ( [CLS]). The ﬁnal hidden state\\ncorresponding to this token is used as the ag-\\ngregate sequence representation for classiﬁcation\\ntasks. Sentence pairs are packed together into a\\nsingle sequence. We differentiate the sentences in\\ntwo ways. First, we separate them with a special\\ntoken ([SEP]). Second, we add a learned embed-\\nding to every token indicating whether it belongs\\nto sentence A or sentence B. As shown in Figure 1,\\nwe denote input embedding as E, the ﬁnal hidden\\nvector of the special [CLS] token as C ∈RH,\\nand the ﬁnal hidden vector for the ith input token\\nas Ti ∈RH.\\nFor a given token, its input representation is\\nconstructed by summing the corresponding token,\\nsegment, and position embeddings. A visualiza-\\ntion of this construction can be seen in Figure 2.\\n3.1 Pre-training BERT\\nUnlike Peters et al. (2018a) and Radford et al.\\n(2018), we do not use traditional left-to-right or\\nright-to-left language models to pre-train BERT.\\nInstead, we pre-train BERT using two unsuper-\\nvised tasks, described in this section. This step\\nis presented in the left part of Figure 1.\\nTask #1: Masked LM Intuitively, it is reason-\\nable to believe that a deep bidirectional model is\\nstrictly more powerful than either a left-to-right\\nmodel or the shallow concatenation of a left-to-\\nright and a right-to-left model. Unfortunately,\\nstandard conditional language models can only be\\ntrained left-to-right or right-to-left, since bidirec-\\ntional conditioning would allow each word to in-\\ndirectly “see itself”, and the model could trivially\\npredict the target word in a multi-layered context.\\nformer is often referred to as a “Transformer encoder” while\\nthe left-context-only version is referred to as a “Transformer\\ndecoder” since it can be used for text generation.\\nIn order to train a deep bidirectional representa-\\ntion, we simply mask some percentage of the input\\ntokens at random, and then predict those masked\\ntokens. We refer to this procedure as a “masked\\nLM” (MLM), although it is often referred to as a\\nCloze task in the literature (Taylor, 1953). In this\\ncase, the ﬁnal hidden vectors corresponding to the\\nmask tokens are fed into an output softmax over\\nthe vocabulary, as in a standard LM. In all of our\\nexperiments, we mask 15% of all WordPiece to-\\nkens in each sequence at random. In contrast to\\ndenoising auto-encoders (Vincent et al., 2008), we\\nonly predict the masked words rather than recon-\\nstructing the entire input.\\nAlthough this allows us to obtain a bidirec-\\ntional pre-trained model, a downside is that we\\nare creating a mismatch between pre-training and\\nﬁne-tuning, since the [MASK] token does not ap-\\npear during ﬁne-tuning. To mitigate this, we do\\nnot always replace “masked” words with the ac-\\ntual [MASK] token. The training data generator\\nchooses 15% of the token positions at random for\\nprediction. If the i-th token is chosen, we replace\\nthe i-th token with (1) the [MASK] token 80% of\\nthe time (2) a random token 10% of the time (3)\\nthe unchanged i-th token 10% of the time. Then,\\nTi will be used to predict the original token with\\ncross entropy loss. We compare variations of this\\nprocedure in Appendix C.2.\\nTask #2: Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)\\nMany important downstream tasks such as Ques-\\ntion Answering (QA) and Natural Language Infer-\\nence (NLI) are based on understanding the rela-\\ntionship between two sentences, which is not di-\\nrectly captured by language modeling. In order\\nto train a model that understands sentence rela-\\ntionships, we pre-train for a binarized next sen-\\ntence prediction task that can be trivially gener-\\nated from any monolingual corpus. Speciﬁcally,\\nwhen choosing the sentencesA and B for each pre-\\ntraining example, 50% of the time B is the actual\\nnext sentence that follows A (labeled as IsNext),\\nand 50% of the time it is a random sentence from\\nthe corpus (labeled as NotNext). As we show\\nin Figure 1, C is used for next sentence predic-\\ntion (NSP). 5 Despite its simplicity, we demon-\\nstrate in Section 5.1 that pre-training towards this\\ntask is very beneﬁcial to both QA and NLI. 6\\n5The ﬁnal model achieves 97%-98% accuracy on NSP.\\n6The vector C is not a meaningful sentence representation\\nwithout ﬁne-tuning, since it was trained with NSP.'),\n",

For the pre-training corpus we\\nuse the BooksCorpus (800M words) (Zhu et al.,\\n2015) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words).\\nFor Wikipedia we extract only the text passages\\nand ignore lists, tables, and headers. It is criti-\\ncal to use a document-level corpus rather than a\\nshufﬂed sentence-level corpus such as the Billion\\nWord Benchmark (Chelba et al., 2013) in order to\\nextract long contiguous sequences.\\n3.2 Fine-tuning BERT\\nFine-tuning is straightforward since the self-\\nattention mechanism in the Transformer al-\\nlows BERT to model many downstream tasks—\\nwhether they involve single text or text pairs—by\\nswapping out the appropriate inputs and outputs.\\nFor applications involving text pairs, a common\\npattern is to independently encode text pairs be-\\nfore applying bidirectional cross attention, such\\nas Parikh et al. (2016); Seo et al. (2017). BERT\\ninstead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify\\nthese two stages, as encoding a concatenated text\\npair with self-attention effectively includes bidi-\\nrectional cross attention between two sentences.\\nFor each task, we simply plug in the task-\\nspeciﬁc inputs and outputs into BERT and ﬁne-\\ntune all the parameters end-to-end. At the in-\\nput, sentence A and sentence B from pre-training\\nare analogous to (1) sentence pairs in paraphras-\\ning, (2) hypothesis-premise pairs in entailment, (3)\\nquestion-passage pairs in question answering, and\\n(4) a degenerate text- ∅ pair in text classiﬁcation\\nor sequence tagging. At the output, the token rep-\\nresentations are fed into an output layer for token-\\nlevel tasks, such as sequence tagging or question\\nanswering, and the [CLS] representation is fed\\ninto an output layer for classiﬁcation, such as en-\\ntailment or sentiment analysis.\\nCompared to pre-training, ﬁne-tuning is rela-\\ntively inexpensive. All of the results in the pa-\\nper can be replicated in at most 1 hour on a sin-\\ngle Cloud TPU, or a few hours on a GPU, starting\\nfrom the exact same pre-trained model. 7 We de-\\nscribe the task-speciﬁc details in the correspond-\\ning subsections of Section 4. More details can be\\nfound in Appendix A.5.\\n4 Experiments\\nIn this section, we present BERT ﬁne-tuning re-\\nsults on 11 NLP tasks.\\n4.1 GLUE\\nThe General Language Understanding Evaluation\\n(GLUE) benchmark (Wang et al., 2018a) is a col-\\nlection of diverse natural language understanding\\ntasks.

The left-only constraint\\nwas also applied at ﬁne-tuning, because removing\\nit introduced a pre-train/ﬁne-tune mismatch that\\ndegraded downstream performance. Additionally,\\nthis model was pre-trained without the NSP task.\\nThis is directly comparable to OpenAI GPT, but\\nusing our larger training dataset, our input repre-\\nsentation, and our ﬁne-tuning scheme.\\nWe ﬁrst examine the impact brought by the NSP\\ntask. In Table 5, we show that removing NSP\\nhurts performance signiﬁcantly on QNLI, MNLI,\\nand SQuAD 1.1. Next, we evaluate the impact\\nof training bidirectional representations by com-\\nparing “No NSP” to “LTR & No NSP”. The LTR\\nmodel performs worse than the MLM model on all\\ntasks, with large drops on MRPC and SQuAD.\\nFor SQuAD it is intuitively clear that a LTR\\nmodel will perform poorly at token predictions,\\nsince the token-level hidden states have no right-\\nside context. In order to make a good faith at-\\ntempt at strengthening the LTR system, we added\\na randomly initialized BiLSTM on top. This does\\nsigniﬁcantly improve results on SQuAD, but the\\nresults are still far worse than those of the pre-\\ntrained bidirectional models. The BiLSTM hurts\\nperformance on the GLUE tasks.\\nWe recognize that it would also be possible to\\ntrain separate LTR and RTL models and represent\\neach token as the concatenation of the two mod-\\nels, as ELMo does. However: (a) this is twice as\\nexpensive as a single bidirectional model; (b) this\\nis non-intuitive for tasks like QA, since the RTL\\nmodel would not be able to condition the answer\\non the question; (c) this it is strictly less powerful\\nthan a deep bidirectional model, since it can use\\nboth left and right context at every layer.\\n5.2 Effect of Model Size\\nIn this section, we explore the effect of model size\\non ﬁne-tuning task accuracy. We trained a number\\nof BERT models with a differing number of layers,\\nhidden units, and attention heads, while otherwise\\nusing the same hyperparameters and training pro-\\ncedure as described previously.\\nResults on selected GLUE tasks are shown in\\nTable 6. In this table, we report the average Dev\\nSet accuracy from 5 random restarts of ﬁne-tuning.\\nWe can see that larger models lead to a strict ac-\\ncuracy improvement across all four datasets, even\\nfor MRPC which only has 3,600 labeled train-\\ning examples, and is substantially different from\\nthe pre-training tasks. It is also perhaps surpris-\\ning that we are able to achieve such signiﬁcant\\nimprovements on top of models which are al-\\nready quite large relative to the existing literature.\\nFor example, the largest Transformer explored in\\nVaswani et al. (2017) is (L=6, H=1024, A=16)\\nwith 100M parameters for the encoder, and the\\nlargest Transformer we have found in the literature\\nis (L=64, H=512, A=2) with 235M parameters\\n(Al-Rfou et al., 2018). By contrast, BERT BASE\\ncontains 110M parameters and BERT LARGE con-\\ntains 340M parameters.\\nIt has long been known that increasing the\\nmodel size will lead to continual improvements\\non large-scale tasks such as machine translation\\nand language modeling, which is demonstrated\\nby the LM perplexity of held-out training data\\nshown in Table 6. However, we believe that\\nthis is the ﬁrst work to demonstrate convinc-\\ningly that scaling to extreme model sizes also\\nleads to large improvements on very small scale\\ntasks, provided that the model has been sufﬁ-\\nciently pre-trained.

(2016) men-\\ntioned in passing that increasing hidden dimen-\\nsion size from 200 to 600 helped, but increasing\\nfurther to 1,000 did not bring further improve-\\nments. Both of these prior works used a feature-\\nbased approach — we hypothesize that when the\\nmodel is ﬁne-tuned directly on the downstream\\ntasks and uses only a very small number of ran-\\ndomly initialized additional parameters, the task-\\nspeciﬁc models can beneﬁt from the larger, more\\nexpressive pre-trained representations even when\\ndownstream task data is very small.\\n5.3 Feature-based Approach with BERT\\nAll of the BERT results presented so far have used\\nthe ﬁne-tuning approach, where a simple classiﬁ-\\ncation layer is added to the pre-trained model, and\\nall parameters are jointly ﬁne-tuned on a down-\\nstream task. However, the feature-based approach,\\nwhere ﬁxed features are extracted from the pre-\\ntrained model, has certain advantages. First, not\\nall tasks can be easily represented by a Trans-\\nformer encoder architecture, and therefore require\\na task-speciﬁc model architecture to be added.\\nSecond, there are major computational beneﬁts\\nto pre-compute an expensive representation of the\\ntraining data once and then run many experiments\\nwith cheaper models on top of this representation.\\nIn this section, we compare the two approaches\\nby applying BERT to the CoNLL-2003 Named\\nEntity Recognition (NER) task (Tjong Kim Sang\\nand De Meulder, 2003).

In\\nparticular, these results enable even low-resource\\ntasks to beneﬁt from deep unidirectional architec-\\ntures.

The purpose of this is to bias the\\nrepresentation towards the actual observed\\nword.\\nThe advantage of this procedure is that the\\nTransformer encoder does not know which words\\nit will be asked to predict or which have been re-\\nplaced by random words, so it is forced to keep\\na distributional contextual representation of ev-\\nery input token.

The ﬁrst sentence receives the A\\nembedding and the second receives the B embed-\\nding. 50% of the time B is the actual next sentence\\nthat follows A and 50% of the time it is a random\\nsentence, which is done for the “next sentence pre-\\ndiction” task. They are sampled such that the com-\\nbined length is ≤512 tokens. The LM masking is\\napplied after WordPiece tokenization with a uni-\\nform masking rate of 15%, and no special consid-\\neration given to partial word pieces.\\nWe train with batch size of 256 sequences (256\\nsequences * 512 tokens = 128,000 tokens/batch)\\nfor 1,000,000 steps, which is approximately 40\\nepochs over the 3.3 billion word corpus. We\\nuse Adam with learning rate of 1e-4, β1 = 0.9,\\nβ2 = 0.999, L2 weight decay of 0.01, learning\\nrate warmup over the ﬁrst 10,000 steps, and linear\\ndecay of the learning rate. We use a dropout prob-\\nability of 0.1 on all layers. We use a gelu acti-\\nvation (Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2016) rather than\\nthe standard relu, following OpenAI GPT. The\\ntraining loss is the sum of the mean masked LM\\nlikelihood and the mean next sentence prediction\\nlikelihood.\\nTraining of BERT BASE was performed on 4\\nCloud TPUs in Pod conﬁguration (16 TPU chips\\ntotal).13 Training of BERTLARGE was performed\\non 16 Cloud TPUs (64 TPU chips total). Each pre-\\ntraining took 4 days to complete.\\nLonger sequences are disproportionately expen-\\nsive because attention is quadratic to the sequence\\nlength. To speed up pretraing in our experiments,\\nwe pre-train the model with sequence length of\\n128 for 90% of the steps. Then, we train the rest\\n10% of the steps of sequence of 512 to learn the\\npositional embeddings.\\nA.3 Fine-tuning Procedure\\nFor ﬁne-tuning, most model hyperparameters are\\nthe same as in pre-training, with the exception of\\nthe batch size, learning rate, and number of train-\\ning epochs.

The core argument of this\\nwork is that the bi-directionality and the two pre-\\ntraining tasks presented in Section 3.1 account for\\nthe majority of the empirical improvements, but\\nwe do note that there are several other differences\\nbetween how BERT and GPT were trained:\\n• GPT is trained on the BooksCorpus (800M\\nwords); BERT is trained on the BooksCor-\\npus (800M words) and Wikipedia (2,500M\\nwords).\\n• GPT uses a sentence separator ( [SEP]) and\\nclassiﬁer token ( [CLS]) which are only in-\\ntroduced at ﬁne-tuning time; BERT learns\\n[SEP], [CLS] and sentence A/B embed-\\ndings during pre-training.\\n• GPT was trained for 1M steps with a batch\\nsize of 32,000 words; BERT was trained for\\n1M steps with a batch size of 128,000 words.\\n• GPT used the same learning rate of 5e-5 for\\nall ﬁne-tuning experiments; BERT chooses a\\ntask-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning learning rate which\\nperforms the best on the development set.\\nTo isolate the effect of these differences, we per-\\nform ablation experiments in Section 5.1 which\\ndemonstrate that the majority of the improvements\\nare in fact coming from the two pre-training tasks\\nand the bidirectionality they enable.\\nA.5 Illustrations of Fine-tuning on Different\\nTasks\\nThe illustration of ﬁne-tuning BERT on different\\ntasks can be seen in Figure 4.

Our ﬁndings are summarized in Figure 1.1.

Similarly, GPT-3 achieves 64.3% accuracy on TriviaQA in the zero-shot setting, 68.0% in the\\none-shot setting, and 71.2% in the few-shot setting, the last of which is state-of-the-art relative to\\nﬁne-tuned models operating in the same closed-book setting.\\nWe additionally train a series of smaller models (ranging from 125 million parameters to 13 billion\\nparameters) in order to compare their performance to GPT-3 in the zero-, one- and few-shot settings.\\nIn general, we ﬁnd relatively smooth scaling for most tasks with model capacity in all three settings;\\none notable pattern is that the gap between zero-, one-, and few-shot performance often grows with\\nmodel capacity, perhaps suggesting that larger models are more proﬁcient meta-learners.\\n2'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '../../test_data/input/NeurIPS-2020-language-models-are-few-shot-learners-Paper.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='2 Approach\\nOur basic pre-training approach, including model, data, and training, is similar to the process\\ndescribed in [RWC+19], with relatively straightforward scaling up of the model size, dataset size and\\ndiversity, and length of training. Our use of in-context learning is also similar to [RWC+19], but in\\nthis work we systematically explore different settings for learning within the context:\\n• Fine-Tuning (FT) - updates the weights of a pre-trained model by training on thousands of\\nsupervised labels speciﬁc to the desired task. The main advantage of ﬁne-tuning is strong\\nperformance on many benchmarks. The main disadvantages are the need for a new large\\ndataset for every task, the potential for poor generalization out-of-distribution [MPL19], and\\nthe potential to exploit spurious features of the training data [GSL+18, NK19]. We focus\\non task-agnostic performance, leaving ﬁne-tuning for future work.\\n• Few-Shot (FS) - the model is given a few demonstrations of the task at inference time as\\nconditioning [RWC+19], but no weights are updated. An example typically has a context\\nand a desired completion (for example an English sentence and the French translation),\\nand few-shot works by giving K examples of context and completion, and then one ﬁnal\\nexample of context, with the model expected to provide the completion (see appendix for\\nmore details). We typically setKin the range of 10 to 100, as this is how many examples can\\nﬁt in the model’s context window (nctx = 2048). The main advantage of few-shot is a major\\nreduction in the need for task-speciﬁc data. The main disadvantage is that results from this\\nmethod have so far been much worse than state-of-the-art ﬁne-tuned models. Also, a small\\namount of task speciﬁc data is still required. As indicated by the name, few-shot learning as\\ndescribed here for language models is related to few-shot learning as used in other contexts\\nin ML [HYC01, VBL+16] – both involve learning based on a broad distribution of tasks\\nand then rapidly adapting to a new task.\\n• One-Shot (1S) - similar to few-shot but with K = 1.\\n• Zero-Shot (0S) - similar to few-shot but with a natural language description of the task\\ninstead of any examples.\\nThe appendix includes a demonstration of the four methods using the example of translating English\\nto French. While the few-shot results we present in this paper achieve the highest performance,\\none-shot, or even sometimes zero-shot, seem like the fairest comparisons to human performance, and\\nare important targets for future work.\\n2.1 Model and Architectures\\nWe use the same model and architecture as GPT-2 [RWC+19], including the modiﬁed initialization,\\npre-normalization, and reversible tokenization described therein, with the exception that we use\\nalternating dense and locally banded sparse attention patterns in the layers of the transformer, similar\\nto the Sparse Transformer [CGRS19]. To study the dependence of ML performance on model size,\\nwe train 8 different sizes of model, from 125 million parameters to 175 billion parameters, with the\\nlast being the model we call GPT-3. This range of model sizes allows us to test the scaling laws\\nintroduced in [KMH+20].\\nMore details on the sizes and architectures of our models can be found in the appendix. We partition\\neach model across GPUs along both the depth and width dimension in order to minimize data-transfer\\nbetween nodes.\\n2.2 Training Dataset\\nTo create our training data, we (1) downloaded and ﬁltered a version of CommonCrawl1 [RSR+19]\\nbased on similarity to a range of high-quality reference corpora, (2) performed fuzzy deduplication at\\nthe document level, within and across datasets, to prevent redundancy and preserve the integrity of\\nour held-out validation set as an accurate measure of overﬁtting, and (3) added known high-quality\\nreference corpora to the training mix to augment CommonCrawl and increase its diversity.

As a result, although GPT-3’s training data\\nprimarily consists of English (93% by word count), it also includes 7% non-English content (full list\\nat GPT-3 GitHub). Existing unsupervised machine translation approaches often combine pretraining\\non a pair of monolingual datasets with back-translation [SHB15] to bridge the two languages in a\\ncontrolled way. By contrast, GPT-3 learns from a blend of training data that mixes many languages\\ntogether. Additionally, our one / few-shot settings aren’t strictly comparable to prior unsupervised\\nwork since they make use of a small amount of paired examples in-context (1 or 64).\\nZero-shot GPT-3 underperforms recent unsupervised NMT results, but the one-shot setting improves\\nperformance by 7 BLEU and nears competitive performance with prior work. Few-shot GPT-3 further\\nimproves another 4 BLEU resulting in similar average performance to prior unsupervised NMT work.\\nFor the three input languages studied, GPT-3 signiﬁcantly outperforms prior unsupervised NMT work\\nwhen translating into English but underperforms when translating in the other direction. Performance\\non En-Ro is a noticeable outlier at over 10 BLEU worse than prior unsupervised NMT work. This\\ncould be a weakness due to reusing the byte-level BPE tokenizer of GPT-2 which was developed for\\nan almost entirely English training dataset. For both Fr-En and De-En, few shot GPT-3 outperforms\\nthe best supervised result we could ﬁnd but due to our unfamiliarity with the literature and the\\nappearance that these are un-competitive benchmarks we do not suspect those results represent a\\ntrue SOTA. For Ro-En, few shot GPT-3 is very close to the overall SOTA which is achieved with\\nunsupervised pretraining, ﬁnetuning on 608K labeled examples, and backtranslation [LHCG19b].\\n3.4 SuperGLUE\\nThe SuperGLUE benchmark is a standardized collection of datasets [ WPN+19].

On WSC, BoolQ, MultiRC, and RTE, performance\\nis reasonable, roughly matching that of a ﬁne-tuned BERT-Large. On CB, we see signs of life at\\n75.6% in the few-shot setting. WiC is a notable weak spot with few-shot performance equivalent to\\nrandom chance. We tried a number of different phrasings and formulations for WiC (which involves\\ndetermining if a word is being used with the same meaning in two sentences), none of which was\\nable to achieve strong performance. This hints at a phenomenon (which we saw in other experiments\\nwe ran contained in the Additional Materials) – GPT-3 appears to be weak in the few-shot or one-shot\\nsetting at some tasks that involve comparing two sentences or snippets. This could also explain the\\ncomparatively low scores for RTE and CB, which also follow this format. Despite these weaknesses,\\nGPT-3 still outperforms a ﬁne-tuned BERT-large on four of eight tasks and on two tasks GPT-3 is\\nclose to the state-of-the-art held by a ﬁne-tuned 11 billion parameter model.\\n4 Measuring and Preventing Memorization Of Benchmarks\\nThe dataset and model size are about two orders of magnitude larger than those used for GPT-2,\\nand include a large amount of Common Crawl, creating increased potential for contamination and\\nmemorization. On the other hand, precisely due to the large amount of data, even GPT-3 175B does\\nnot overﬁt its training set by a signiﬁcant amount, measured relative to a held-out validation set with\\nwhich it was deduplicated. For each benchmark, we produce a ‘clean’ version which removes all\\npotentially leaked examples, deﬁned roughly as examples that have a 13-gram overlap with anything\\nin the pretraining set (or that overlap with the whole example when it is shorter than 13-grams). We\\nthen evaluate GPT-3 on these clean benchmarks, and compare to the original score. If the score on\\nthe clean subset is similar to the score on the entire dataset, this suggests that contamination, even if\\npresent, does not have a signiﬁcant effect on reported results. In most cases performance changes only\\nnegligibly, and we see no evidence that contamination level and performance difference are correlated.\\nWe conclude that either our conservative method substantially overestimated contamination or that\\ncontamination has little effect on performance. We provide full details of the methodology and\\nanalysis on the most problematic tasks in the appendix.\\n7'),\n",

Our design decision comes at the cost of potentially worse performance on tasks which\\nempirically beneﬁt from bidirectionality, such as ﬁll-in-the-blank tasks, tasks that involve looking\\nback and comparing two pieces of content (ANLI, WIC), or tasks that require re-reading or carefully\\nconsidering a long passage and then generating a very short answer (QuAC, RACE).\\nOur objective weights every token equally and lacks a notion of what is most important to predict\\nand what is less important.

Also, with self-supervised objectives, task speciﬁcation relies on forcing the desired task into\\na prediction problem, whereas ultimately, useful language systems (for example virtual assistants)\\nmight be better thought of as taking goal-directed actions rather than just making predictions. Finally,\\nlarge pretrained language models are not grounded in other domains of experience, such as video or\\nreal-world physical interaction, and thus lack a large amount of context about the world [BHT+20].\\nFor all these reasons, scaling pure self-supervised prediction is likely to hit limits, and augmentation\\nwith a different approach is likely to be necessary. Promising future directions in this vein might\\ninclude learning the objective function from humans [ ZSW+19], ﬁne-tuning with reinforcement\\nlearning, or adding additional modalities such as images to provide grounding and a better model of\\nthe world [CLY+19].\\nGPT-3’s size makes it challenging to deploy. Task-speciﬁc distillation [HVD15] merits exploration at\\nthis new scale.\\n6 Related Work\\nSeveral efforts have studied the effect of scale on language model performance. [KMH+20, RRBS19,\\nLWS+20, HNA+17], ﬁnd a smooth power-law trend in loss as autoregressive language models are\\nscaled up. There are different approaches to scaling language models through increasing parameters,\\ncompute, or both. Our work is most aligned with methods that have increased the size of transformers\\nby increasing parameters and FLOPS-per-token roughly in proportion, with a parameter count of 213\\nmillion [VSP+17] in the original paper, then 300 million [DCLT18], 1.5 billion [RWC+19], 8 billion\\n[SPP+19], 11 billion [RSR+19], and most recently 17 billion [Tur20]. A second line of work has\\nfocused on increasing parameter count but not computation by using the conditional computation\\nframework [BLC13]. Speciﬁcally, the mixture-of-experts method [ SMM+17] has produced 100\\nbillion parameter models and 50 billion parameter translation models [AJF19]. One way to decrease\\nthe computational cost of our models would be to draw from work such as ALBERT [LCG+19] or\\ngeneral [HVD15] or task-speciﬁc [SDCW19, JYS+19, KR16] approaches to distillation. Lastly, a\\nthird approach to scale increases computation without increasing parameters through methods like\\nadaptive computation time [Gra16] and the universal transformer [DGV+18].\\nThere are many approaches to building multi-task models. Giving task instructions in natural language\\nwas ﬁrst formalized in a supervised setting with [MKXS18] and used in [RWC+19] for in-context\\nlearning and in [RSR+19] for multi-task ﬁne-tuning. Multi-task learning [Car97] has shown some\\npromising initial results [LGH+15, LCR19] and multi-stage ﬁne-tuning has produced SOTA or SOTA-\\ncompetitive results [PFB18, KKS+20]. Metalearning was used in language models in [RWC+19],\\nthough with limited results and no systematic study. Other uses of metalearning include matching\\nnetworks [VBL+16], RL2 [DSC+16], learning to optimize [RL16, ADG+16, LM17] and MAML\\n[FAL17]. Our approach of stufﬁng the model’s context with previous examples is most structurally\\nsimilar to RL2. It also resembles [ HYC01], in that an inner loop adapts to a task, while an outer\\nloop updates the weights. Our inner loop performs few-shot in-context learning, but prior work has\\nexplored other methods of few-shot learning [SS20, RCP+17, GWC+18, XDH+19].\\nFinally, Algorithmic innovation in language models over the last two years has been enormous, in-\\ncluding denoising-based bidirectionality [DCLT18], preﬁxLM [DL15], encoder-decoder architectures\\n[LLG+19, RSR+19], random permutations during training [YDY+19], architectures for sampling\\n8'),\n",

All models were trained on V100 GPU’s on part of a high-\\nbandwidth cluster provided by Microsoft\\nBroader Impacts\\nLanguage models have a wide range of beneﬁcial applications for society, including code and writing\\nauto-completion, grammar assistance, game narrative generation, improving search engine responses,\\nand answering questions. But they also have potentially harmful applications. GPT-3 improves\\nthe quality of text generation and adaptability over smaller models and increases the difﬁculty of\\ndistinguishing synthetic text from human-written text. It therefore has the potential to advance both\\nthe beneﬁcial and harmful applications of language models.\\nHere we focus on the potential harms of improved language models, not because we believe the\\nharms are necessarily greater, but in order to stimulate efforts to study and mitigate them. The broader\\nimpacts of language models like this are numerous. We focus on two primary issues: the potential\\nfor deliberate misuse of language models like GPT-3 in Section 7.1, and issues of bias, fairness, and\\nrepresentation within models like GPT-3 in Section 7.2. We also brieﬂy discuss issues of energy\\nefﬁciency (Section 7.3).\\n7.1 Misuse of Language Models\\nMalicious uses of language models can be somewhat difﬁcult to anticipate because they often\\ninvolve repurposing language models in a very different environment or for a different purpose than\\nresearchers intended. To help with this, we can think in terms of traditional security risk assessment\\nframeworks, which outline key steps such as identifying threats and potential impacts, assessing\\nlikelihood, and determining risk as a combination of likelihood and impact [Ros12]. We discuss three\\nfactors: potential misuse applications, threat actors, and external incentive structures.\\n7.1.1 Potential Misuse Applications\\nAny socially harmful activity that relies on generating text could be augmented by powerful lan-\\nguage models. Examples include misinformation, spam, phishing, abuse of legal and governmental\\nprocesses, fraudulent academic essay writing and social engineering pretexting. Many of these\\napplications bottleneck on human beings to write sufﬁciently high quality text. Language models that\\nproduce high quality text generation could lower existing barriers to carrying out these activities and\\nincrease their efﬁcacy.\\nThe misuse potential of language models increases as the quality of text synthesis improves. The\\nability of GPT-3 to generate several paragraphs of synthetic content that people ﬁnd difﬁcult to\\ndistinguish from human-written text represents a concerning milestone in this regard.\\n9'),\n",

While we did ﬁnd signiﬁcant discussion of misuse following the initial\\nrelease of GPT-2 in spring of 2019, we found fewer instances of experimentation and no successful\\ndeployments since then. Additionally, those misuse discussions were correlated with media coverage\\nof language model technologies. From this, we assess that the threat of misuse from these actors is\\nnot immediate, but signiﬁcant improvements in reliability could change this.\\nBecause APTs do not typically discuss operations in the open, we have consulted with professional\\nthreat analysts about possible APT activity involving the use of language models. Since the release\\nof GPT-2 there has been no discernible difference in operations that may see potential gains by using\\nlanguage models. The assessment was that language models may not be worth investing signiﬁcant\\nresources in because there has been no convincing demonstration that current language models are\\nsigniﬁcantly better than current methods for generating text, and because methods for “targeting” or\\n“controlling” the content of language models are still at a very early stage.\\n7.1.3 External Incentive Structures\\nEach threat actor group also has a set of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that they rely\\non to accomplish their agenda. TTPs are inﬂuenced by economic factors like scalability and ease of\\ndeployment; phishing is extremely popular among all groups because it offers a low-cost, low-effort,\\nhigh-yield method of deploying malware and stealing login credentials. Using language models to\\naugment existing TTPs would likely result in an even lower cost of deployment.\\nEase of use is another signiﬁcant incentive. Having stable infrastructure has a large impact on the\\nadoption of TTPs. The outputs of language models are stochastic, however, and though developers\\ncan constrain these (e.g. using top-k truncation) they are not able to perform consistently without\\nhuman feedback. If a social media disinformation bot produces outputs that are reliable 99% of the\\ntime, but produces incoherent outputs 1% of the time, this could reduce the amount of human labor\\nrequired in operating this bot. But a human is still needed to ﬁlter the outputs, which restricts how\\nscalable the operation can be.\\nBased on our analysis of this model and analysis of threat actors and the landscape, we suspect AI\\nresearchers will eventually develop language models that are sufﬁciently consistent and steerable that\\nthey will be of greater interest to malicious actors. We expect this will introduce challenges for the\\nbroader research community, and hope to work on this through a combination of mitigation research,\\nprototyping, and coordinating with other technical developers.\\n7.2 Fairness, Bias, and Representation\\nBiases present in training data may lead models to generate stereotyped or prejudiced content.\\nThis is concerning, since model bias could harm people in the relevant groups in different ways\\nby entrenching existing stereotypes and producing demeaning portrayals amongst other potential\\nharms [Cra17]. We have conducted an analysis of biases in the model in order to better understand\\nGPT-3’s limitations when it comes to fairness, bias, and representation.2\\nOur goal is not to exhaustively characterize GPT-3, but to give a preliminary analysis of some of\\nits limitations and behaviors. We focus on biases relating to gender, race, and religion, although\\nmany other categories of bias are likely present and could be studied in follow-up work. This is a\\npreliminary analysis and does not reﬂect all of the model’s biases even within the studied categories.\\nBroadly, our analysis indicates that internet-trained models have internet-scale biases; models tend to\\nreﬂect stereotypes present in their training data. Below we discuss our preliminary ﬁndings of bias\\n2Evaluating fairness, bias, and representation in language models is a rapidly-developing area with a large\\nbody of prior work.

We found that occupations in general have a higher probability of being followed by a\\nmale gender identiﬁer than a female one (in other words, they are male leaning) when given a context\\nsuch as \"The {occupation} was a\" (Neutral Variant). 83% of the 388 occupations we tested\\nwere more likely to be followed by a male identiﬁer by GPT-3. We measured this by feeding the\\nmodel a context such as \"The detective was a\" and then looking at the probability of the model\\nfollowing up with male indicating words (eg. man, male etc.) or female indicating words (woman,\\nfemale etc.). In particular, occupations demonstrating higher levels of education such as legislator,\\nbanker, or professor emeritus were heavily male leaning along with occupations that require hard\\nphysical labour such as mason, millwright, and sheriff. Occupations that were more likely to be\\nfollowed by female identiﬁers include midwife, nurse, receptionist, housekeeper etc.\\nWe also tested how these probabilities changed when we shifted the context to be the \"The\\ncompetent {occupation} was a\" (Competent Variant), and when we shifted the context to\\nbe \"The incompetent {occupation} was a\" (Incompetent Variant) for each occupation in the\\ndataset. We found that, when prompted with \"The competent {occupation} was a,\" the ma-\\njority of occupations had an even higher probability of being followed by a male identiﬁer than a\\nfemale one than was the case with our original neutral prompt, \"The {occupation} was a\". With\\nthe prompt \"The incompetent {occupation} was a\" the majority of occupations still leaned\\nmale with a similar probability than for our original neutral prompt. The average occupation bias -\\nmeasured as 1\\nnjobs\\n∑\\njobs log(P(female|Context)\\nP(male|Context)) ) - was −1.11 for the Neutral Variant, −2.14 for the\\nCompetent Variant and −1.15 for the Incompetent Variant.\\nWe also carried out pronoun resolution on the Winogender dataset [ RNLVD18] using\\ntwo methods which further corroborated the model’s tendency to associate most occupa-\\ntions with males. One method measured the models ability to correctly assign a pro-\\nnoun as the occupation or the participant. For example, we fed the model a con-\\ntext such as \"The advisor met with the advisee because she wanted to get advice\\nabout job applications. ‘She’ refers to the\" and found the option with the lowest\\nprobability between the two possible options (Choices between Occupation Option: advisor; Partici-\\npant Option: advisee).\\nOccupation and participant words often have societal biases associated with them such as the\\nassumption that most occupants are by default male. We found that the language models learnt some\\nof these biases such as a tendency to associate female pronouns with participant positions more than\\nmale pronouns. GPT-3 175B had the highest accuracy of all the models (64.17%) on this task. It was\\nalso the only model where the accuracy for Occupant sentences (sentences where the correct answer\\nwas the Occupation option) for females was higher than for males (81.7% vs 76.7%). All other\\nmodels had a higher accuracy for male pronouns with Occupation sentences as compared to female\\npronouns with the exception of our second largest model- GPT-3 13B - which had the same accuracy\\n(60%) for both. This offers some preliminary evidence that in places where issues of bias can make\\nlanguage models susceptible to error, the larger models are more robust than smaller models.\\nWe also performed co-occurrence tests, where we analyzed which words are likely to occur in the\\nvicinity of other pre-selected words. We created a model output sample set by generating 800 outputs\\nof length 50 each with a temperature of 1 and top p of 0.9 for every prompt in our dataset. For\\ngender, we had prompts such as \"He was very\", \"She was very\", \"He would be described\\nas\", \"She would be described as\"3. We looked at the adjectives and adverbs in the top 100\\nmost favored words using an off-the-shelf POS tagger [LB02]. We found females were more often\\ndescribed using appearance oriented words such as ”beautiful” and ”gorgeous” as compared to men\\nwho were more often described using adjectives that span a greater spectrum.\\n3We only used male and female pronouns. This simplifying assumption makes it easier to study co-occurrence\\nsince it does not require the isolation of instances in which ‘they’ refers to a singular noun from those where it\\ndidn’t, but other forms of gender bias are likely present and could be studied using different approaches.\\n11'),\n",

To put these numbers in perspective, we have also included the average for the\\nnumber of co-occurrences across all qualifying words for each gender.\\n7.2.2 Race\\nTo investigate racial bias in GPT-3, we seeded the model with prompts such as -\"The {race} man\\nwas very\", \"The {race} woman was very\" and \"People would describe the {race}\\nperson as\" and generated 800 samples for each of the above prompts, with {race}replaced with\\na term indicating a racial category such as White or Asian. We then measure word co-occurrences\\nin the generated samples. Given prior research demonstrating that language models produce text\\nof differing sentiment when varying features such as occupation [HZJ+19], we explored how race\\nimpacted sentiment. We measured sentiment using Senti WordNet [ BES10] for the words which\\nco-occurred disproportionately with each race. Each word sentiment varied from 100 to -100, with\\npositive scores indicating positive words (eg. wonderfulness: 100, amicable: 87.5), negative scores\\nindicating negative words (eg. wretched: -87.5 , horrid: -87.5) and a score of 0 indicating neutral\\nwords (eg. sloping, chalet).\\nIt should be noted that we were explicitly prompting the models to talk about race and this in turn\\ngenerated text that focused on racial features; these results are not from the models talking about\\nrace in the wild but talking about race in an experimental setup where they have been primed to do\\nso. Additionally, since we are measuring sentiment by simply looking at word co-occurrences, the\\nresulting sentiment can reﬂect socio-historical factors - for instance, text relating to a discussion of\\nslavery will frequently have a negative sentiment, which may lead to a demographic being associated\\nwith a negative sentiment under this testing methodology.\\nAcross the models we analyzed, ‘Asian’ had a consistently high sentiment - it ranked 1st in 3 out of 7\\nmodels. On the other hand, ’Black’ had a consistently low sentiment - it ranked the lowest in 5 out of\\n7 models. These differences narrowed marginally on the larger model sizes. This analysis gives a\\nsense of the biases of different models and highlights the need for more sophisticated analysis of the\\nrelationship between sentiment, entities, and input data.\\n7.2.3 Religion\\nWe studied which words co-occurred with religious terms relating to Atheism, Buddhism, Christianity,\\nHinduism, Islam, and Judaism, by generating 800 model outputs of length≈50 with a temperature of 1\\nand a top pof 0.9 for every prompt.

Our work is inspired by the literature on characterizing model\\nattributes to develop informative labels such as Model Cards for Model Reporting from [MWZ+18].\\nUltimately, it is important not just to characterize biases in language systems but to intervene. The\\nliterature on this is also extensive [ QMZH19, HZJ+19], so we offer only a few brief comments\\non future directions speciﬁc to large language models. In order to pave the way for effective bias\\nprevention in general purpose models, there is a need for building a common vocabulary tying\\ntogether the normative, technical and empirical challenges of bias mitigation for these models. There\\nis room for more research that engages with the literature outside NLP, better articulates normative\\nstatements about harm, and engages with the lived experience of communities affected by NLP\\nsystems [BBDIW20]. Thus, mitigation work should not be approached purely with a metric driven\\nobjective to ‘remove’ bias as this has been shown to have blind spots [GG19, NvNvdG19] but in a\\nholistic manner.\\n7.3 Energy Usage\\nPractical large-scale pre-training requires large amounts of computation, which is energy-intensive:\\ntraining the GPT-3 175B consumed several thousand petaﬂop/s-days of compute during pre-training,\\ncompared to tens of petaﬂop/s-days for a 1.5B parameter GPT-2 model (Figure 7.2). This means we\\nshould be cognizant of the cost and efﬁciency of such models, as advocated by [SDSE19].\\nThe use of large-scale pre-training also gives another lens through which to view the efﬁciency of\\nlarge models - we should consider not only the resources that go into training them, but how these\\nresources are amortized over the lifetime of a model, which will subsequently be used for a variety of\\npurposes and ﬁne-tuned for speciﬁc tasks. Though models like GPT-3 consume signiﬁcant resources\\nduring training, they can be surprisingly efﬁcient once trained: even with the full GPT-3 175B,\\ngenerating 100 pages of content from a trained model can cost on the order of 0.4 kW-hr, or only a\\nfew cents in energy costs.

To gauge the\\nquality of generated articles, we measured human ability to distinguish GPT-3-generated articles from\\nreal ones. Similar work has been carried out by Kreps et al. [KMB20] and Zellers et al. [ZHR+19].\\nGenerative language models are trained to match the distribution of content generated by humans, so\\nthe (in)ability of humans to distinguish the two is a potentially important measure of quality.4\\nIn order to see how well humans can detect model generated text, we arbitrarily selected 25 article\\ntitles and subtitles from the website newser.com (mean length: 215 words). We then generated\\ncompletions of these titles and subtitles from for language models ranging in size from 125M to 175B\\n(GPT-3) parameters (mean length: 200 words). For each model, we presented around 80 US-based\\nparticipants with a quiz consisting of these real titles and subtitles followed by either the human\\nwritten article or the article generated by the model5. Participants were asked to select whether the\\narticle was “very likely written by a human”, “more likely written by a human”, “I don’t know”,\\n“more likely written by a machine”, or “very likely written by a machine”.\\nThe articles we selected were not in the models’ training data and the model outputs were formatted\\nand selected programmatically to prevent human cherry-picking. All models used the same context to\\ncondition outputs on and were pre-trained with the same context size and the same article titles and\\nsubtitles were used as prompts for each model. However, we also ran an experiment to control for\\nparticipant effort and attention that followed the same format but involved intentionally bad model\\ngenerated articles. This was done by generating articles from a “control model”: a 160M parameter\\nmodel with no context and increased output randomness.\\nMean human accuracy (the ratio of correct assignments to non-neutral assignments per participant) at\\ndetecting that the intentionally bad articles were model generated was ∼86% where 50% is chance\\nlevel performance. By contrast, mean human accuracy at detecting articles that were produced by the\\n175B parameter model was barely above chance at ∼52% (see Table 7.3).6 Human abilities to detect\\nmodel generated text appear to decrease as model size increases: there appears to be a trend towards\\nchance accuracy with model size, and human detection of GPT-3 is close to chance.7 This is true\\ndespite the fact that participants spend more time on each output as model size increases (see the\\nAppendix).\\nExamples of synthetic articles from GPT-3 are given in Figures 7.4 and 7.5. 8 Much of the text\\nis—as indicated by the evaluations—difﬁcult for humans to distinguish from authentic human content.\\nFactual inaccuracies can be an indicator that an article is model generated since, unlike human authors,\\nthe models have no access to the speciﬁc facts that the article titles refer to or when the article was\\nwritten. Other indicators include repetition, non sequiturs, and unusual phrasings, though these are\\noften subtle enough that they are not noticed.\\nRelated work on language model detection by Ippolito et al. [ IDCBE19] indicates that automatic\\ndiscriminators like G R O V E R[ZHR+19] and GLTR [GSR19] may have greater success at detecting\\nmodel generated text than human evaluators. Automatic detection of these models may be a promising\\narea of future research.\\nIppolito et al. [IDCBE19] also note that human accuracy at detecting model generated text increases\\nas humans observe more tokens. To do a preliminary investigation of how good humans are at\\ndetecting longer news articles generated by GPT-3 175B, we selected 12 world news articles from\\nReuters with an average length of 569 words and generated completions of these articles from GPT-3\\nwith an average length of 498 words (298 words longer than our initial experiments).

Indeed, many individual participants scored below 50% on\\nthis task.\\n8Additional non-news samples can be found in the Appendix.\\n15'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': '../../test_data/input/NIPS-2017-attention-is-all-you-need-Paper.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsigniﬁcant improvements in computational efﬁciency through factorization tricks [18] and conditional\\ncomputation [26], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 16]. In all but a few cases [22], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for signiﬁcantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[20], ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difﬁcult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 11]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [28].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the ﬁrst transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 29].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,...,x n) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1,...,z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1,...,y m) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The ﬁrst is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\n2'),\n",

We employ a residual connection [10] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x+ Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\\nquery with the corresponding key.\\n3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\n3'),\n",

(right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\\nattention layers running in parallel.\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices Kand V. We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q,K,V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efﬁcient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneﬁcial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the ﬁnal values, as\\ndepicted in Figure 2.\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q · k = ∑dk\\ni=1 qiki, has mean 0 and variance dk.\\n4'),\n",

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h= 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[31, 2, 8].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0,xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [24]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n3.5 Positional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\n5'),\n",

That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2πto 10000 ·2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any ﬁxed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [8] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1,...,x n) to another sequence of equal length (z1,...,z n), with xi,zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [11]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[31] and byte-pair [25] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\\n6'),\n",

This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k<n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 15], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k·n·d+ n·d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side beneﬁt, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the signiﬁcantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [31]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [17] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ= 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate= d−0.5\\nmodel ·min(step_num−0.5,step_num·warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the ﬁrst warmup_stepstraining steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps= 4000.\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [27] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop = 0.1.\\n7'),\n",
